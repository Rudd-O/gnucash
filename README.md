Seriously, just use Ledger.

GnuCash refuses to support Bitcoin.  It's highly cumbersome to use.
Its development is glacial-paced.  The UI leaves a lot to be desired, is
quirky, inconsistent.  Multi-currency transactions lose precision (which is
essentially a no-go with Bitcoin).  The reporting capabilities suck.
Your GnuCash data is in a very hard-to-understand and process XML file.
Getting your profits and losses from currency trading seems to be a non-
priority for the developers.

Just use Ledger.  It's so much better.
